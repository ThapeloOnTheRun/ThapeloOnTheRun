After eight weeks of no running, it was the time to test if the stress fracture is healed. I decided to do Treadmill running every other day for first few runs post the injury.
This is how week 1 went.

Pain level = 1/10

Fitness level = 1/10

I scored the pain level 1/10 because I feel like my head is playing games with me. It was more focused of detecting a pain, basically, I was expecting some discomfort.
Fitness level, gradually increased to something like 1.5/10. But on average, the fitness was just not there.
