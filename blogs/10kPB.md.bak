After months of inconsistent running and injuries, I discovered the phrases "BASE BUILDING" and "STRENGTH TRAINING". In the preceding few months, I had suffered from shin splints and soleus muscle injuries after I had discovered "SANCTIONED RACES". I fell into the trap of overdoing pretty much everything (i.e. "training" and racing). By training I mean some random running, once every other day. Basically, go out and run as fast as you possibly can all the time.

I decided to give the base building and strength training a chance as they could apparently help one avoid injuries (my worst nightmares). I did a series of web searches and YouTube for some plans that I could live with for both base building and strength training. I stumbled across a 12-week base building plan and thought that was forever and I won't be able to finish it up (spoiler alert, I did). I incorporated basic leg training and core strengthening routines. ALL WAS GOING WELL.

## Training

As mentioned above, I did a 12 week based building structured as:

Of course, I didn't follow the plan exactly, but I would say I did over 95 % of the plan. A few weeks towards the end of the plan, I was to travel to Cape Town and I realised that there was a mid-week night run that I could participate in. I think I added two more weeks of 64 km towards the Growthpoint Sundowner 10km. I registered for the race and it took part on the 12th of December 2023 at 18:30.




## Race strategy

Arrived near the starting point at 17:30 and collected my bib. Put it on and prepare for a warm-up.

I did a 15-minute jog for warm up plus 4 x strides and headed to the start line.
