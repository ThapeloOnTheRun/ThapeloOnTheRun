Preparation for this race followed a 10 km race (Urithi legacy) I had just done on the 4th of February 2024. I did the race with a finish time of 50:15 (Horrible race). The half marathon was scheduled for the 21st of April 2024. 
I had about 11 weeks to prepare. 

## Training

For this training block,  I ran an average of 5 days a week. The training block was disrupted few times because of my international travels and family commitment but such is life.
I structured my training such that I had 2 (two) speed sessions. 1 pure speed day that I did generally on a Tuesday and a race specific speed day that I did either on a Thurday or Saturday (Long run workout). I gradually increased my weekly mileage from 60 something and peaked at 78 km (Maybe that was too much). I then did a 2 weeks taper.


## Race strategy

The plan was to dip under 1:50. Going into this race I had my PB at 1:58:something. I was too ambitious.

# Fueling
I had **USN Vooma Ultra Sports Performance Gel Vanilla 36g** every 30 minutes, rougly after 6 km. I had also 250 ml **Rehidrat Oral Electrolyte Mixture** that I sipped randomly to keep myself hydrated.

# Pacing

I knew that the course is quite hilly after 14 - 15 km. I expected that I would run a positive split race (second half slower than first).

I finished the race with the official time of 1:50:40. The second was tough but I am happy with the time.


## Post Race

Coffee and snacks. Thanks to my friend's access to Team Vitality's hospitalities.
