      <description>Thapelo got INJURED&#xA;Official diagnosis - Stress Fracture (Right Fibula)&#xA;A few runs post my Half-marathon PB, I started feeling a slight pain in my lower leg. The pain was not there when I walked and ran, I could only feel it when I pressed hard around the injured area. I figured that it was just a niggle that will go away.&#xA;I proceeded to run another half-marathon on the 1st of May 2024 (Official time - 1:50:15).</description>

      <description>Preparation for this race followed a 10 km race (Urithi legacy) I had just done on the 4th of February 2024. I did the race with a finish time of 50:15 (Horrible race). The half marathon was scheduled for the 21st of April 2024. I had about 11 weeks to prepare.&#xA;Training For this training block, I ran an average of 5 days a week. The training block was disrupted a few times because of my international travels and family commitments but such is life.</description>

      <description>After months of inconsistent running and injuries, I discovered the phrases &amp;ldquo;BASE BUILDING&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;STRENGTH TRAINING&amp;rdquo;. In the preceding few months, I had suffered from shin splints and soleus muscle injuries after I had discovered &amp;ldquo;SANCTIONED RACES&amp;rdquo;. I fell into the trap of overdoing pretty much everything (i.e. &amp;ldquo;training&amp;rdquo; and racing). By training I mean some random running, once every other day. Basically, go out and run as fast as you possibly can all the time.</description>
