## Week 1 - Base Building

I have decided to do my training on a softer surface. Not a bad idea, I might keep this for a while. I completed four (4) runs during the first week of running outdoors and one (1) cross-training session. Here is the summary in a Table below
### 04 to 11 August 2024

Monday |Tuesday    | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday| Total|
-------- | -------- | ------- |-------- | -------- | ------- |--------|--------
|30 min <br> @ Easy| Rest | 30 min <br> @ Easy | 30 min <br> @ Easy | Rest |45 min <br> @ Easy | 30 min <br> Indoor cycling| 2:15:49 (excl. XTrain) <br> 23.66 km|

Pain level = 0/10

Fitness level = 2.5/10

## How did the runs go and feel?

The first thing that I noticed was that I was going a bit faster for the same level of exertion I know I have put in for my easy runs as compared to my pre-stress fracture injury. 
I initially thought that it was because I was too excited to get running again, but the same trend continued throughout the week. After my 45-minute run on Saturday (11/08/2024), I went deep into the stats to try and see why I am going about 30 seconds/km quicker as compared to my pre-injury easy runs. Here is the comparison of the pre and post-injury 8 km easy runs.

I looked at two parameters; (1) cadence and (2) stride length. 

I noticed that my cadence remained the same at around 160 spm, however, my stride length had increased by about 10 cm. That meant that every stride I made covered 0.1 m more distance as compared to my pre-injury days.

## What caused an increased in the stride length?

As I have mentioned when I initially felt pains in my lower right leg, I consulted a physio who then determined that I have limited hip mobility and weak glutes.
She then encouraged me to do the following exercises to improve the two (2) weaknesses that she discovered.
### Exercise 1

Side-Lying Clamshell - 3 sets of 10 reps each side.

### Exercise 2

Figure 4 Stretch - 30 seconds on each side.

I tried to be as consistent as I could be. I progressed to add more glutes strengthening exercises and hip mobility exercises.

I added on some days the following exercises.

### Exercises

1. Hip 90/90.
2. Spiderman Quad Pull Rocks.
3. Cossack Hip Rock.
4. Toe touch squats.
5. Banded donkey kicks.

I believe that all these exercises contributed to the observations I made in week 1 of outdoor running.
