**Thapelo got INJURED**

Official diagnosis - **Stress Fracture (Right Fibula)**

Few runs post my Half-marathon PB, I started feeling a slight pain on the lower leg. The pain was not there when I walked and ran, I could only feel it when I *pressed hard* around the injured area. I figured that it was just a niggle that will go away.

I proceeded to run another half-marathon on the 1st of May 2024 (Official time - 1:50:15). Aubrey Mmotong really pulled me for few kilometers, GRATEFUL. I then did a 15 km at the colgate race (1:58:02).

The niggle did not go anywhere. I decided to see a physio. I was told to take a few days off and get back at it. First day after the rest, I first felt the pain during the run and went to the physio who then referred me to specialists. I did an ultra scan, it was inconclusive. I went for an X-Ray and the fracture was visible. 

## Initial pain

## Recovery

Decided to take few days off although they said I can do stationary cycling at the gym. I started going to the gym after 3 - 4 weeks from when I felt the pain during the run. 
I took up cycling and elliptical. Quite boring. I decided to do weight lifting, upper body. I am enjoying it.

## Getting back

I followed the advice from Ben Parkes (Runner/Youtuber - https://benparkes.com/blogs/news/return-to-running-video-plans).

I performed these four tests on the 21 July 2024 pain free:

1. 30-45 minute walk
2. 20 hops on the injured leg
3. 20-30 single leg calf raises on the injured leg
4. Run on the spot or high knees for at least 100 strides (Did around 50 and I was out of breath)
