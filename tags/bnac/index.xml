      <description>Preparation for this race followed a 10 km race (Urithi legacy) I had just done on the 4th of February 2024. I did the race with a finish time of 50:15 (Horrible race). The half marathon was scheduled for the 21st of April 2024. I had about 11 weeks to prepare.&#xA;Training For this training block, I ran an average of 5 days a week. The training block was disrupted a few times because of my international travels and family commitments but such is life.</description>
