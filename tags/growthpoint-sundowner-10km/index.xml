      <description>After months of inconsistent running and injuries, I discovered the phrases &amp;ldquo;BASE BUILDING&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;STRENGTH TRAINING&amp;rdquo;. In the preceding few months, I had suffered from shin splints and soleus muscle injuries after I had discovered &amp;ldquo;SANCTIONED RACES&amp;rdquo;. I fell into the trap of overdoing pretty much everything (i.e. &amp;ldquo;training&amp;rdquo; and racing). By training I mean some random running, once every other day. Basically, go out and run as fast as you possibly can all the time.</description>
